Concepts of Boto3:

- Session
- Resources
- Client
- Meta
- Collections
- Waiters
- Paginators

1: Session:

- In simple words, it is just the **AWS Management Console**.
- Store configuration information (Credentials of Default user etc‚Ä¶).
- Allows us to create Service, Clients and Resources.
- It creates a default session for us when we need it.
- We can create multiple sessions in the same script!

2: Resource/Services(like s3 , ec2, iam‚Ä¶ect.. resource is northing but AWS services )

- You can choose anyone depending on your use case.
- Resource is **Higher Level Object** oriented service access.
- Resource objects are only available for a few AWS Services.
- Let us check which AWS Service has a Resource Object!!! - DEMüòâ
- **['cloudformation', 'cloudwatch', 'dynamodb', 'ec2', 'glacier', 'iam', 'opsworks', 's3', 'sns', 'sqs'] - Resource Object Available.**

3: Client/Service(like s3 , ec2, iam‚Ä¶ect.. resource is northing but AWS services):

- Client is **Low Level Service Access**.
- In simple terms, the output/response in case of Client will be in Dictionary, which needs more effort in implementing boto3 scripts.
- Whereas Resource is an object, we can use simple (.) operation.
- **All operations that we see in AWS Management Console can be done in Client whereas Resource does not guarantee you that. Some operations may not be supported.**
- If we do not have some operations in Resource we can enter into Client by using the **‚ÄúMeta‚Äù** concept. Let us talk about this later! üòâ
- Let us see how much effort is needed for both Resource and Client. - DEMüòÄ

4: Meta

5: Collections:

6: Waiters:

- **It allows you to block the code until the process in completed**

7: Paginators:

- **If we have more than one page results then we use paginators**
- eg: For IAM service CLIENT method will list only 100 users. If we want to list more we use Paginators
- For S3 it has 1000 results, if want to print more than 1000 use Paginator.
- **The man advantage of Paginators is we get the result quickly**
